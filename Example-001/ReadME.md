<H3>The 'Example-01' Test</H3>

This is a very basic example about the use of the C++ programming language. Basically, it is similar to the classic <i>'Hello World'</i> for testing the correctness of the building infrastructure.<p>In particular, it is builds the <i>'Example-01'</i> executable,
starting uniquely from the <i>'Example-01.cpp'</i> C++ source file (in the <i>'src'</i> folder) without using other dependencies.<p>Several methods for its building are provided.

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i></h4>This test is built by using the <i>classic</i> instructions for building a program with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>:
<pre>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</pre><p>Also the content of several variables is shown during the building process.<p>This test is executed with:<pre>./Example-01</pre>

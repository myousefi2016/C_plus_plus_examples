<H3>The 'Example-083' Test</H3>

This basic test about the use of the C++ programming language validates the definition and the implementation of a <code><i>'class'</i></code> (the most important construct for an object-oriented programming language) within any custom <code><i>'namespace'</i></code>. This latter is a declarative region, which provides a scope for a bunch of identifiers (i.e., the names of types, functions, variables, and so on), thus, not only classes. <code><i>'Namespaces'</i></code> are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions, that may occur especially when including multiple libraries. All identifiers in the <code><i>'namespace'</i></code> scope are visible to one another without qualification. Instead, identifiers outside the <code><i>'namespace'</i></code> can access the members by using their fully qualified name.<p>In this test, the <i>'my_namespace'</i> custom <code><i>'namespace'</i></code> is proposed, containing the brief definition and the implementation for the <i>'MyClass'</i> custom class. This class has a bunch of <i>'private'</i> member fields (namely <i>'3</i> integer values), that are accessed by a collection of <i>'getter/setter'</i> inline member functions. This class is also equipped with a member function, which exporting the values of its member fields on a generic output stream (not necessarily a file). In this test, a number of instances of the <i>'MyClass'</i> are directly allocated by exploiting their constructors and destructor member functions in conjunction with the <code><i>'exceptions'</i></code> mechanism. Several capabilities, offered by the C++11 standard, are also exploited.<p>In particular, this test consists of the <i>'Example-083'</i> executable file, which is based on several components. These latter are distributed in a few files:<ul>
<li>the <i>'main()'</i> function is implemented in the <i>'main.cpp'</i> C++ source file (in the <i><code>'src'</code></i> folder);</li>
<li>the <i>'MyClass'</i> class is defined in the <i>'my_class.h'</i> C++ header file (in the <i><code>'include'</code></i> folder);</li>
<li>the implementation of the member functions, offered by the <i>'MyClass'</i> class, is stored in the <i>'my_class.cpp'</i> C++ source file (in the <i><code>'src'</code></i> folder).</li></ul><p>Several methods for building this test are provided, and their building infrastructure is saved in the following folders:<p><ul>
<li>the <i><code>'cmake'</code></i> folder contains the project file for the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>;</li>
<li>the <i><code>'vstudio'</code></i> folder contains the solution file for the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i>;</li>
<li>the <i><code>'xcode'</code></i> folder contains the project file for the <i><A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Apple XCode</A></i>.</li></ul><p><table border=1 width=100%><tr><td><p><b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b><p>It is clear that this test can be built and run ONLY if your C++ compiler is a C++11-compliant compiler. The most recent versions of the compilers in the current literature are C++11-compliant.<p></td></tr></table><p><hr><p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i></h4>

This test is built by using the <i>classic</i> instructions for building a program with the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i> from the <i><code>'cmake'</code></i> folder:
<pre>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</pre><p>As mentioned above, the <i>'Example-083'</i> executable file is created. For instance, this test is executed by running:<pre>./Example-083</pre><p>This building method is tested with the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"><i>GCC</i></A> under the Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 (LTS), as well as with the <A href="http://clang.llvm.org/"><i>CLANG</i></A> compiler under the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan (and higher), and the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A> under the Microsoft Windows 10.

In this latter case, three custom projects are automatically generated, and ready to be open in the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A>. The solution file of interest is the <i>'Example-083.sln'</i> solution file, which can be open and built without being modified.<p>An interested user finds more details about other possible customization options in the Official Documentation of the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.<p><hr><p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i></h4>

This test is also built by using the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A>. In particular, the <i><code>'vstudio'</code></i> folder contains the <i>'Example-083.sln'</i> solution file, which can be open and built without being modified. It can be built by clicking on the <i>'Build'</i> command.

Note that this solution file is independently created from scratch, and is different from the solution file, which may be generated automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.<p>An interested user finds more details in the Official Documentation of the <i><A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Microsoft Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</A></i>.<p><hr><p>

<h4>Instructions for building this test with the <i><A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Apple XCode</A></i></h4>

This test is also built by using the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A> (based on the <A href="http://clang.llvm.org/"><i>CLANG</i> compiler</A>) under the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan (and higher). In particular, the <i><code>'xcode'</code></i> folder contains the <i>'Example-083.xcodeproj'</i> project file, which can be open and built without being modified. It can be built by clicking on the <i>'Build & Run'</i> command. The resulting <i>'Example-083'</i> executable file is stored in the <i><code>'Build/Products/Debug/'</code></i> folder, if the debugging symbols are included, or in the <i><code>'Build/Products/Release/'</code></i> folder, otherwise.<p>

Note that this project file is independently created from scratch, and is different from the project file, which may be generated automatically by the <i><A href="http://cmake.org">CMake Building Tool</A></i>.<p>An interested user finds more details in the Official Documentation of the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>Apple XCode</i></A>.<p><hr><p><table border=1><tr><td><p><b>ATTENTION:</b><p>All trademarks or registered trademarks are the property of their respective owners.</td></tr></table>

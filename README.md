<center><IMG src="http://davidcanino.github.io/img/logo-sun.jpg" border="0" width="180" height="97"></center><p>

This repository contains several examples of increasing complexity and difficulty, that may form an elementary tutorial about the understanding of the beautiful C++ programming language.<p>Several examples will be based on the new C++11 and C++-14 capabilities.<p>

All examples in this repository are tested with the <A href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"><i>GCC</i></A> under the Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 (LTS), as well as the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>XCode</i></A> (based on the <A href="http://clang.llvm.org/"><i>CLANG</i></A> compiler) under the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan (and higher), and the <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A> under the MS Windows 10.

Their <A href="http://cmake.org"><i>CMAKE</i></A> building infrastructure is provided, as well as the corresponding <A href="http://www.visualstudio.com/"><i>Visual Studio (Community Edition 2015)</i></A> and the <A href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/"><i>XCode</i></A> projects.

Each test example will be its guide (currently under progress).
